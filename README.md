In this Capstone project, you will: Design a data platform that uses MySQL as an OLTP database and MongoDB as a NoSQL database. Design and implement a data warehouse and generate reports from the data. Design a reporting dashboard that reflects the key metrics of the business. Extract data from OLTP and NoSQL databases, transform it and load it into the data warehouse, and then create an ETL pipeline. And finally, create a Spark connection to the data warehouse, and then deploy a machine learning model.

1. In Module 1, you will design the OLTP database for an E-Commerce website, populate the OLTP Database with the data provided and automate the export of the daily incremental data into the data warehouse. 

2. In Module 2, you will set up a NoSQL database to store the catalog data for an E-Commerce website, load the E-Commerce catalog data into the NoSQL database, and query the E-Commerce catalog data in the NoSQL database. 

3. In Module 3, you will design the schema for a data warehouse based on the schema of the OLTP and NoSQL databases. Youâ€™ll then create the schema and load the data into fact and dimension tables, automate the daily incremental data insertion into the data warehouse, and create Cubes and Rollups to make the reporting easier. 

4. In Module 4, you will create a Cognos data source that points to a data warehouse table, create a bar chart of Quarterly sales of cell phones, create a pie chart of sales of electronic goods by category, and create a line chart of total sales per month for the year 2020. 

5. In Module 5, you will extract data from OLTP, NoSQL, and MongoDB databases into CSV format. 
You will then transform the OLTP data to suit the data warehouse schema and then load the transformed data into the data warehouse. Finally, you will verify that the data is loaded properly. 

6. In the final Module 6, you will use your skills in Big Data Analytics to create a Spark connection to the data warehouse, and then deploy a machine learning model on SparkML for making sales projections.
